                <font color="navy">tweet from Salma</font>
                </a>. Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible. But here we are. I'm
                trying my best.

            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p>
                The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables
                with a <code>role="presentation"</code> attribute
                to make decorated sections without css. If you view
                source on the page, you'll see that there are a LOT
                of tables. The table tag typically is used to display
                tabular data and should NOT be used as a layout method.
                However, since I am not allowed to use CSS, I am
                pretty much exclusively relying on tables for this purpose.
                The presentation role tells the browser to not expose
                the table and its tabluar children in the accessibility
                tree. This will make it easier to navigate for assistive
                technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements
                from HTML 3.2 that you should never use. In order
                to be "compliant", I've added the HTML 3.2 doctype
                at the top of the page:<br>
                <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;</code><br>
                This helps give a hint to the browser that we are
                going to use some older stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as
                <code>details</code>/<code>summary</code>,
                <code>section</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>header</code>,
                and <code>footer</code>. So I'm just making a mess of my doctype
                and what I should be actually using!
